This is a toolkit used for first filtering out reads mapping to a reference genome and then mapping those remaining reads to a database file of pathogens, thus getting the overall depth and coverage of thos reads in regards to a the pathogens. This pipeline was originally written by Basir Shariat, however, The project was then passed on to me and I made mad some fairly heavy modifications.  

Of this toolkit I wrote:

convertSamToFastq.sh
trimContaminants.py

Of this toolkit I modified:

pathogen_detection.py 


Functions that I wrote in pathogen_detection.py: 
processSamFile(binaryMask,samFileName,fastqPrefix,isChrom,ResFile)
calcStats(depthTables,alignmentCounts,isChrom,ResFile)
dumpFastqFiles(readsToFastq,fqReads)
addToCoverageMap(mapping,alignmentCounts,depthTables)
getAllMappings(fields)

Functions that I modified in pathogen_detection.py:
align_reads_to_references(genomes, fr, rr, output_dir, clean)
align_reads_to_pathogens(genomes, reads, output_dir, clean)
assemble_remaining_reads(filteredReads, output_dir)
main()
